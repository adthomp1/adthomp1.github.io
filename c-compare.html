<p>To many people, the terms open source and free are associated with a lack of features and support. Fortunately, this is not the case with LibreOffice. Almost anything you can do with Microsoft Office, you can do with LibreOffice, and more!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's look at what's contained in LibreOffice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writer - a full featured word processor, comparable to MS Word</li>
<li>Calc - a spreadsheet program, comparable to MS Excel</li>
<li>Impress - the presentation creator, comparable to MS Power Point</li>
<li>Base - a powerful database front end, comparable to MS Access</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>LibreOffice also contains two more pieces of software that are not analogous to anything contained in MS Office:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw - a drawing a flowchart application</li>
<li>Math - an equation editor</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>In addition, LibreOffice is totally open source and free! There are even versions that can be run from a <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/portable-versions/">USB drive</a> and don't have to be installed on the computer at all.</p>
